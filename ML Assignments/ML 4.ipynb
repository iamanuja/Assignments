    "\n",
    "**Ans:** \n",
    "**Qualitative Data(Categorical Data)**\n",
    "Qualitative data is a set of information which can not be measured using numbers. It generally consist of words, subjective narratives. Categorical data can take numerical values. For example, maybe we would use 1 for the colour red and 2 for blue. But these numbers don’t have a mathematical meaning. That is, we can’t add them together or take the average.\n",
    "It contains 2 types :\n",
    "**Nominal** : “Nominal” scales could simply be called “labels.”  Note: a sub-type of nominal scale with only two categories (e.g. male/female) is called “dichotomous.”\n",
    "**Ordinal** : “Ordinal” is easy to remember because is sounds like “order” and that’s the key to remember with\n",
    "“ordinal scales”– it is the order that matters, but that’s all you really get from these. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Quantitative data (Numerical Data:)** Numerical data is any data where data points are exact numbers. Statisticians also might call numerical data, quantitative data. This data has meaning as a measurement such as house prices or as a count, such as a number of residential properties in Los Angeles or how many houses sold in the past year.\n",
    "It contains 2 types :\n",
    "**discrete** : Discrete data refers to countable, individualized, and nondivisible figures in statistics. These data points exist only in set increments. Data analysts and statisticians visualize discrete data using bar graphs, line charts, histograms, and pie charts.\n",
    "**continous** : Continuous data is a type of numerical data that refers to the unspecified number of possible measurements between two realistic points."

    "\n",
    "1. **Numeric vs. categorical attributes:**  \n",
    "- Numerical data are values obtained for quantitative variable, and carries a sense of magnitude related to the context of the variable (hence, they are always numbers or symbols carrying a numerical value). \n",
    "- Categorical data are values obtained for a qualitative variable. categorical data numbers do not carry a sense of magnitude.\n",
    "- Numerical data always belong to either ordinal, ratio, or interval type, whereas categorical data belong to nominal  type. - - Methods used to analyse quantitative data are different from the methods used for categorical data, even if the principles are the same at least the application has significant differences.\n",
    "- Numerical data are analysed using  statistical methods in descriptive statistics, regression, time series and many more.For categorical data usually descriptive methods and graphical methods are employed. Some non-parametric tests are also used.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Feature selection vs. dimensionality reduction**  \n",
    "- Feature selection you just select a subset of the original feature set, without any manipulation of the data on the other hand.\n",
    "- Dimensionality reduction is typically choosing a new representation within which you can describe most but not all of the variance within your data, thereby retaining the relevant information, while reducing theamount of information necessary to represent it."

    "3. PCA (Personal Computer Aid)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** The Quick notes on the following three topics is:\n",
    "\n",
    "**The histogram:** A histogram is a graphical representation of a grouped frequency distribution with continuous classes. It is an area diagram and can be defined as a set of rectangles with bases along with the intervals between class boundaries and with areas proportional to frequencies in the corresponding classes.It is interpreted visual by taking many data points and grouping them into logical ranges or bins.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use a scatter plot:** Scatter plots are the graphs that present the relationship between two variables in a data-set. It represents data points on a two-dimensional plane or on a Cartesian system. The independent variable or attribute is plotted on the X-axis, while the dependent variable is plotted on the Y-axis. These plots are often called scatter graphs or scatter diagrams.\n",
    "**Scatter plots are used in either of the following situations.**\n",
    "1. When we have paired numerical data\n",
    "2. When there are multiple values of the dependent variable for a unique value of an independent variable\n",
    "3. In determining the relationship between variables in some scenarios, such as identifying potential root causes of problems, checking whether two products that appear to be related both occur with the exact cause and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "**PCA (Personal Computer Aid):** Principal Component Analysis or PCA is a widely used technique for dimensionality reduction of the large data set. Reducing the number of components or features costs some accuracy and on the other hand, it makes the large data set simpler, easy to explore and visualize. "

    "**Ans:** Depending on the specific characteristics of the data, there are several ways to handle outliers in a dataset. Let’s review a few of the most common approaches to handle outliers below:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Remove outliers:**\n",
    "In some cases, it may be appropriate to simply remove the observations that contain outliers. This can be particularly useful if you have a large number of observations and the outliers are not true representatives of the underlying population.\n",
    "**Transform outliers:**\n",
    "The impact of outliers can be reduced or eliminated by transforming the feature. For example, a log transformation of a feature can reduce the skewness in the data, reducing the impact of outliers.\n",
    "**Impute outliers:**\n",
    "In this case, outliers are simply considered as missing values. You can employ various imputation techniques for missing values, such as mean, median, mode, nearest neighbor, etc., to impute the values for outliers.\n",
    "**Use robust statistical methods:**\n",
    "Some of the statistical methods are less sensitive to outliers and can provide more reliable results when outliers are present in the data. For example, we can use median and IQR for the statistical analysis as they are not affected by the outlier’s presence. This way we can minimize the impact of outliers in statistical analysis."

The position of each dot on the horizontal and vertical axis indicates values for an individual data point. So this visualization gives us the idea of bivariate relationship.Scatter plot can also help finding outliers as outliers can be visualized at farther distance than regular data. "
