    "**Ans:** labelled training data means some input data is already tagged with the correct output.labeled training set data provided to the machines work as the supervisor that teaches the machines to predict the output correctly. It applies the same concept as a student learns in the supervision of the teacher."

    "**Ans:** In online learning, you train the system incrementally by feeding it data instances sequentially, either individually or in small groups called mini-batches. Each learning step is fast and cheap, so the system can learn about new data on the fly,\n",
    "Online learning is able to overcome drawbacks of offline learning like models can be updated instantly for any change in data. \n",

    "**Ans:** Model-based learning algorithms search for optimal values of the model parameters such that the model generalizes well for new instances.We measure success by training the system to minimize a cost function which measures how bad the model is at making predictions.In order to make predictions, we pass the testing data to our model and make predictions using our optimized model parameters."

    "**Ans:** hold out some part of the training set in another set that part Andrew Ng calls the train-dev set. After the model is trained (on the training set, not on the train-dev set), you can evaluate it on the train-dev set: if it performs well, then the model is not overfitting the training set, so if performs poorly on the validation set, the problem must come from the data mismatch.

    "##### 19.What could go wrong if you use the test set to tune hyperparameters ?\n",
    "**Ans:** The test set is normally a part of the data that you want to use to check how good the final, trained model will perform on data it has never seen before. If you use this data to choose hyperparameters, you actually give the model a chance to \"see\" the test data and to develop a bias towards this test data. Therefore, you actually lose the possibility to find out how good your model would actually be on unseen data (because it has already seen the test data)."
